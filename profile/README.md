We are an open sourced business. That means all of our documents and organizational information is open sourced. You can find everything in the repos below this readme. Our projects (including client work) are all available online in public repos. If you see a typo on someones site or an error in the code feel free to correct that and send us a PR. Our earnings and shareholder information is available online. We also welcome outside people to jump in on projects and get paid with us. We are currently looking for more people to join our team and would love to hear from you. Send en email to github@hasidic.dev and we can discuss onboarding and employment.
